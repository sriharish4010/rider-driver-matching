## 🧮 The Matching Algorithm

Your system uses a **sophisticated 5-factor scoring system**:

```
FORMULA:
Final Score = (Distance + Vehicle + Rating) × Traffic × Urgency

BREAKDOWN:
1. Distance Score (0-100)
   → Haversine formula calculates km between points
   → Closer drivers score higher

2. Vehicle Bonus (+30)
   → Extra points if driver's vehicle matches rider preference

3. Rating Bonus (0-25)
   → Based on driver's 0-5 star rating

4. Traffic Weight (×0.75 to ×1.0)
   → Low traffic: 1.0× multiplier
   → Medium: 0.9×
   → High: 0.75×

5. Urgency Weight (×0.8 to ×1.3)
   → High urgency: 1.3× multiplier
   → Medium: 1.0×
   → Low: 0.8×
```
